  <h1>ICANN</h1>
  <h2>Finding Expertise</h2>
</div>

<div id="page-intro" class="page">
  <h3>About the Project</h3>
  <p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has managed the system of Internet domains for a decade and a half. Yet as the Internet continues to rapidly evolve and the volume and diversity of stakeholders connecting to the Internet grows, ICANN has recognized it must rethink how it operates as a platform for global collaborative decisionmaking – especially in light of new and increasingly sophisticated communications technologies. The GovLab is working with the <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/about/planning/strategic-engagement/multistakeholder-innovation" target="_blank">ICANN Strategy Panel on Multistakeholder Innovation</a> (MSI Panel), chaired by The GovLab director and co-founder <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/about/planning/strategic-engagement/bios#beth-simone-noveck" target="_blank">Professor Beth Simone Noveck</a>, to research and design technology-enabled experiments to help ICANN engage broader communities and bring their expertise and input into ICANN’s policy development processes.
  <p>Specifically, the Panel has been tasked by Fadi Chehadé, President and CEO of ICANN to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="bullets">Propose new models for international engagement, consensus-driven policymaking and institutional structures to support such enhanced functions; and</li>
    <li class="bullets">Design processes, tools and platforms that enable the global ICANN community to engage in these new forms of participatory decision-making.</li>
  </ul>

      <h3>Stage 1: Idea Generation Stage</h3>

      <p>From November 19, 2013 through the end of 2013, the MSI Panel and The GovLab invited individuals to submit ideas for designing a 21st century ICANN to an online ideation/brainstorming platform. Users were able to rate and rank suggestions based on importance and practicality. The goal was to elicit a wide range of ideas for concrete approaches and tools ICANN could use to evolve and adapt how it works and how it engages with the global public in coordinating policy development in the unique identifier space. To see the ideas, <strong>visit our <a href="http://thegovlab.ideascale.com/">online engagement platform.</a></strong></p>
    </div>

    <div id="stage2" class="tab-content">
      <h3>Stage 2: Proposal Development Stage</h3>
      <p>Idea submissions are presently being grouped into topics to jumpstart development of 16 concrete experiment proposals that ICANN could implement and test toward the end of becoming a more <strong>effective, legitimate and evolving</strong> institution.</p>
      <p>The Panel's master blueprint of proposals is located here:</p>
      <a class="text-box" href="http://bit.ly/1eA7ZrQ" target="_blank">Quest for a 21st Century ICANN</a>

      <p>We’re asking experts and the global public to discuss these initial proposal ideas on <a href="http://thegovlab.org/blog/" target="_blank">The GovLab Blog</a> with line-by-line annotation and commenting features. This stage is designed to take ideas closer to implementation by fleshing out the specifics for what ICANN could/should and should not do in experimenting with new approaches for coordinating policy development and collaborating across borders.</p>
